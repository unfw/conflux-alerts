# conflux-alerts
Open source Stream Alert Manager and chat bot for Streaming sites

# Current plans
This will be a Python basesd desktop app that will listent to events from Twitch, Youtube, and other streaming sites and create an alert overlay based on the type

The goal of the UI is to give a visual obvious flow for events as well as have an in app preview. The current idea is to model the UI based upon something like VNyan.

I also want to give a limited free form code module so that users can be creative in the app without being handcuffed to weird syntax.

This project will be managed as a poetry app
